                The college has four NSS units (Nos. 117, 118, 577 & 578) under the Directorate of Technical Education, Kerala.
                NSS MACE intends to mould engineers par excellence, integrity, human values, social and environmental commitments. 
                What we need are the instruments of social change, Technocrats and Social Engineers. It is indeed the Need of the Hour, to mould a generation, 
                aware of the problems that the society face, and keen to work diligently in the process of Nation Building. Over the last few years, the NSS unit has achieved most of its goals.
                NSS-MACE received IMA-GCDA award for maximum blood donation, Jeevadhayani award for the preparation of online blood donors directory and many other appreciation awards. 
                From cleaning to agricultural works and maintenance, students engage in activities in and out of the campus. The flood during past years brought devastating damage to many lives.
                Mar Athanasius College of Engineering under the supervision of NSS volunteers collected and distributed the essentials to the needy people and also started a refugee camp.

                Initiatives like the E-waste collection campaign, Green carpet - Bhoothathankettu, and distribution of over 10,000 cloth bags over 28 wards of Kothamangalam are helping the cause of a clean and green environment. 
                JALAKAM, coming into being in 2017, brought students from special schools to spend a day at the college campus interacting with the students. DISHA is a Camp initiated for guiding the Tribal students from various parts 
                of Kerala in building their careers. Anti-narcotics awareness rallies, campaigns and classes are organised as a part of the Vimukthi Mission of the Excise Department of Kerala. Blood donation camps are arranged at regular intervals. 
                Various fundraisers are arranged to help patients with their treatments and organ transplant surgeries. There has been a remarkable positive change in the attitude of the students, as a result of the meticulous training process initiated by the NSS.
                It has helped the students to bring in some principles and philosophies in their lives, to help them become mature and enlightened citizens.
